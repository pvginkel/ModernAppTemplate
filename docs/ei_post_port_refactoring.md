# EI Frontend Post-Port Refactoring

After porting ElectronicsInventory onto the frontend template, these refactorings remain. They are listed in priority order — the first two are blocking issues that prevent the project from running on fresh dependency versions.

## 1. TanStack Router Upgrade (1.131 → current)

**Status:** Blocking — the ported project pins versions via EI's old lockfile.
**Fix:** Delete `pnpm-lock.yaml`, run `pnpm install`, fix type errors.
**Scope:** 3 files, ~13 errors

The ported project uses EI's lockfile to pin TanStack Router at 1.131.27. Current versions (~1.161) have breaking type changes in two areas:

### 1a. Route path trailing slashes

The route tree generator changed how index route IDs are formatted. Components using `useNavigate` or `<Link>` with hardcoded paths need updating:

**Files:**
- `src/components/parts/part-list.tsx` (line 36): `useNavigate({ from: '/parts' })` → `'/parts/'`
- `src/components/shopping-lists/detail-header-slots.tsx` (lines 157, 202): `'/shopping-lists/'` → `'/shopping-lists'`
- `src/routes/shopping-lists/$listId.tsx` (line 113): same trailing slash fix

The exact direction of the fix (add vs remove trailing slash) depends on what the route tree generator outputs. Run `pnpm exec tsr generate` and check the route IDs in `src/routeTree.gen.ts`.

### 1b. Navigate `search` params type changes

Components passing `search` as a function to `navigate()` have type errors. The `search` callback signature changed — the `prev` parameter type becomes `never` when the route path doesn't match.

**File:** `src/components/parts/part-list.tsx` (lines 327, 335)

```typescript
// Current (broken with new router)
navigate({
  to: '/parts',
  search: (prev) => ({ ...prev, hasStock: prev.hasStock ? undefined : true }),
});

// Fix: use the correct route path so prev is typed correctly
```

This is the same root cause as 1a — once the route path matches the generated route ID, the `search` type resolves correctly.

## 2. TanStack Query Mutation Callback Signature (5.85 → current)

**Status:** Blocking — same lockfile issue.
**Scope:** 2 files, ~30 errors

The `mutate()` options callbacks (`onSuccess`, `onError`, `onSettled`) changed their argument count. The old API passed 3 arguments; the new API passes 4.

**Files:**
- `src/hooks/use-kit-shopping-list-links.ts` — 12 errors across 4 mutation wrappers
- `src/hooks/use-shopping-lists.ts` — 18 errors across ~18 mutation wrappers

**Pattern:** Every `mutateOptions?.onSuccess?.(data, variables, context)` call needs the additional argument.

Check the TanStack Query migration guide for the exact change. It may be as simple as adding a 4th argument to each callback invocation, or the callback shape may have changed more fundamentally.

## 3. Infrastructure Tests — Keep for Now

**Status:** No action needed yet.

The template mother project does not yet have its own infrastructure test suite. Until it does, EI's infrastructure tests (auth, SSE, deployment, toast, layout, navigation, etc.) are the only place these features get tested. Keep them.

Once the mother project gains infrastructure tests, EI can remove its copies. The infrastructure tests are:

| Directory/File | Tests |
|---------------|-------|
| `tests/e2e/auth/` | OIDC login, logout, session |
| `tests/e2e/deployment/` | Deployment banner, SharedWorker version SSE |
| `tests/e2e/sse/` | SSE task event streaming |
| `tests/e2e/app-shell/` | Toast notification lifecycle |
| `tests/e2e/shell/` | Sidebar navigation, mobile menu |
| `tests/e2e/dialogs/` | Dialog keyboard accessibility |
| `tests/e2e/ui/` | Tooltip display and positioning |
| `tests/e2e/parallel/` | Playwright worker isolation |
| `tests/e2e/test-infrastructure.spec.ts` | Test event instrumentation |
| `tests/e2e/workflows/instrumentation-snapshots.spec.ts` | Instrumentation snapshots |

## 4. Fix `selectors.ts` Re-export Pattern

**Status:** Non-blocking — works now but fragile.
**Scope:** 1 file

EI's `tests/support/selectors.ts` is a template-owned file that EI customized to re-export domain selectors:

```typescript
// EI's version (customized template file)
import { partsSelectors, typesSelectors, boxesSelectors, sellersSelectors } from './selectors-domain';

export const selectors = {
  parts: partsSelectors,   // domain
  types: typesSelectors,   // domain
  boxes: boxesSelectors,   // domain
  sellers: sellersSelectors, // domain
  common: { ... },          // template
};
```

The template's version only has `{ common: {...} }`. On the next `copier update`, EI's customization would be overwritten.

**Two options:**

**Option A (recommended):** Update all page objects to import from `selectors-domain.ts` directly instead of through `selectors.ts`. This eliminates the customization of a template-owned file:

```typescript
// Before (fragile)
import { selectors } from '../selectors';
const input = selectors.parts.form.field('name');

// After (clean)
import { partsSelectors } from '../selectors-domain';
const input = partsSelectors.form.field('name');
```

**Option B:** Update the template's `selectors.ts` to automatically re-export everything from `selectors-domain.ts`. This would benefit all downstream apps but adds coupling between template and app selector shapes.

## 5. Move Misplaced Page Object

**Status:** Non-blocking, cosmetic.
**Scope:** 1 file + import updates

`tests/e2e/types/TypesPage.ts` is a page object sitting in the test directory instead of `tests/support/page-objects/`. Move it to be consistent with all other page objects.

## Execution Order

```
1. Delete lockfile, fresh install, fix router + query errors  ← Unblocks version upgrades
2. Remove infrastructure tests                                 ← Cleanup
3. Fix selectors.ts re-export                                  ← Prevents copier update breakage
4. Move TypesPage.ts                                           ← Cosmetic
```

Items 1 is the only one requiring code changes. Items 2-4 are file moves/deletes. Total code changes: ~43 type errors across 5 files, all following clear patterns.
